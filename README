1. Introduction 
---------------

A basic template for Perl applications that take and parse command line options. Based on the ideas from Perl Best Practices and the GNU style long options reference. It uses only Standard Modules to maintain portability.

The newest version can always be found at:
https://github.com/kimmel/basic-perl-template-for-cli/

bpt_cli.pl - Is a basic cli perl application.

bpt_cli_cf.pl - A basic cli perl app with config file support.


1.1 Design Methodology

The code was formatted with 'perltidy --perl-best-practices' to keep it readable and then run through various levels of perlcritic to see where possible problems are located. The --brutal option checks for everything but I like having the output broken down by theme. I use this script: < https://gist.github.com/1033008 > to save on typing.

I fixed as many of the listed problems as I thought necessary and the perlcritic output for --brutal now reads:

RCS keywords $Id$ not found at line 1, column 1.  See page 441 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)
RCS keywords $Revision$, $HeadURL$, $Date$ not found at line 1, column 1.  See page 441 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)
RCS keywords $Revision$, $Source$, $Date$ not found at line 1, column 1.  See page 441 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)
No package-scoped "$VERSION" variable found at line 1, column 1.  See page 404 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)
Return value of flagged function ignored - print at line 32, column 24.  See pages 208,278 of PBP.  (Severity: 1)
Missing "EXIT STATUS" section in POD at line 42, column 1.  See pages 133,138 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)
Missing "CONFIGURATION" section in POD at line 42, column 1.  See pages 133,138 of PBP.  (Severity: 2)


1.2 Perl Best Practices (PBP):

I think many of the guidelines written by Damian Conway really foster good communication via the code. Here is a break down of the PBP guidelines followed and my synopsis of what they mean in brackets [].

 2.*  Code Layout [ perltidy --perl-best-practices ]

 4.13 Barewords [ use strict; ]
 
 5.5  Punctuation Variables [ use English; ]
 5.7  Match Variables [ use English qw( -no_match_vars ); ]
 
 7.2  Boilerplates [ documentation template for applications ]
 7.4  Location [ the user docs are in the source file ]
 7.5  Contiguity [ put all POD in one location in the source file ]
 7.6  Position [ put all POD at the end of the file ]
 
14.3  Meta-options [ application command line flags ]
14.5  Command-Line Processing [ use Getopt::Long qw( GetOptions ); ]



2. Requirements
---------------
Perl version 5.9.x or later. There is a note in the code for potentially getting these scripts to run on older versions of the Perl 5.x series. In addition, any CPAN modules list at the top of the template selected need to be installed as well.



3. Reporting bugs
-----------------

Please check the Issue queue < https://github.com/kimmel/basic-perl-template-for-cli/issues > and file a report if one is not already present.
